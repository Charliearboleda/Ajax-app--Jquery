# Ajax-app--Jquery
App made using Ajax and Jquery
THe purpose of this app was to design a app that will generate random cat pictures and assign a quote to each image.
I wanted to create something simple and easy to use. Also something that can bring happiness or calmness to someone who is not feeling happy or motivated.
I wanted to include a link for the user to seek help if they are still very depressed or struggling with there mental health.
I created a modal text to the image that will redirect the user to a national directory for mental health in the usa.
The modal briefly describes what the function of the image button will do and what it is for.
first i had to check if the data from the catapi was still valid and check using a console.log(data) to see what would come out on the console.
when i saw the console produced a bunch of information but what i needed was the url link i decided to console.log(data[0.url) and that produce just the link i needed to assign to a button later in my html.

my first day i tried to tackle what i believed would be the hardest thing for me. Html and css. I spent a few hours building different containers and moving things around till it finally started to look like what i wanted certain things to be positioned

The second day i spent time looking for background images button images and thinking of how i wanted the site to look. I researched mental health facilities and alpo searched for images and quotes that would cheer someone who is down and make them feel better

the third day i spent adding those new images to my html styling the words positioning the buttons. Changing the shapes of the buttons and banging my head for a few hours. Things started to look good but i kept thinking of ways i can improve and things i can add to the page. everyday felt like i would scratch three things off my list to do and add five more things to do

day four i began to add the jquery and data from the api all togther. Everything was coming together nicely. i hit a few roadblocks but all together i was able to think of ways to make everything work
